# dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace

[中文](./README.md) | English

## What & Why

An out-of-tree plugin bundle for DSH (DeepSeek Harness) that widens the Workspace write scope from a single canonical directory to "**one primary root + N additional roots**" — **without modifying any package in the upstream repository**.

The problem it solves: a real development project is usually several independent Git repositories, while DSH natively treats only the session working directory as the writable root, so working across repositories means juggling sessions.

Three things make this plugin worth looking at:

- **Zero learning cost for the agent**: it keeps using the native `read` / `write` / `edit` / `bash` tools. The plugin adds no `workspace_*` tools at all; it only widens the answer to the one question "which directories belong to this workspace".
- **Security does not degrade**: the additional roots are granted through the same mechanisms the harness already uses — the in-process fs fence plus kernel-level runners (Seatbelt on macOS, bwrap / Landlock on Linux) — with the fs side and bash/PTY sharing one and the same scope. It never degenerates into danger-full-access or prompt-level constraints.
- **Absent when absent**: it replaces the upstream `fs-sandbox` and `sandbox` provider rows through a bundle patch; with no additional root configured its behavior is item-for-item identical to an uninstalled harness, and every misconfiguration fails loudly instead of silently degrading.

**Upstream baseline & local fork**: this repository is a local fork of [`cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace`](https://github.com/cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace) (vendored, with the `@dsh-electron` scope dropped from the package name), baseline `f149fa4` (one commit past `v0.1.5`). The upstream MVP (milestones M1–M3), the hardening batch (H1–H4), and the `v0.1.2`–`v0.1.5` support-matrix expansions are all included in that baseline. This fork's deltas (one-shot additional-root seeding, common additional roots via `commonRoots` that apply to every primary root, the package rename, and the removal of the upstream release machinery and project-management documents) are recorded in the dotfiles repository's `dsh/README.md` and its commit history; the upstream-style CHANGELOG, roadmap, and plan documents were removed with the fork.

## Quick Start

With a DSH runtime at hand (web / Electron desktop / headless all work), the shortest path is two commands — this repository is a **local fork**: the package dropped its `@dsh-electron` scope (it is `dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` now) and is no longer published to npm with upstream, so it is installed from the local checkout through a pnpm `link:`:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
dsh --profile web
```

Once it is up, the **Folders** action (`🗂`) appears at the sidebar foot — or, straight in a session:

```text
/workspace-folders add ~/code/another-repo
```

The agent can now read, write, and run bash in that directory, with the same rights as this session's workspace. Other install sources (the upstream npm package / the GitHub repository / a local clone) and the command differences of running DSH from a source checkout are covered under [Installation](#installation).

## Requirements

- **Using a plugin built from this checkout**: you need a *supported* DSH runtime — currently **`0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.6-alpha.1`, `0.1.6-alpha.2`, `0.1.7-alpha.1`, `0.1.7-alpha.2`, `0.1.7-rc.1`, `0.1.7-rc.2`, `0.2.0-rc.1`, and `0.2.0-rc.2`**, and nothing else will install or run (see below). `dsh plugin` installs the package into the matching profile, and no local Node toolchain is required
- **Building from source / contributing**: **Node.js** `^22.19.0 || >=24` (pinned by the repository's `engines`), **Git**, and **pnpm 11** (`packageManager` pins `pnpm@11.25.0`; corepack recommended)
- **DSH runtime**: the dev pin is exactly `0.2.0-rc.2`, the baseline among the supported releases; the upgrade procedure lives in the [development workflow](./docs/development/plugin-development-workflow.md)
- **Platforms**: macOS Seatbelt and Linux bwrap/Landlock; a Windows root-set ACL runner is also implemented (it covers the fs write path and ACL grants; multi-root for confined bash/PTY is out of its scope).
- Running the smoke tests needs **no model credentials**: the e2e model turns are served by an inline scripted model endpoint

**The supported DSH versions are an exact list, not a range.** This plugin replaces `ctx.fs` and `ctx.sandbox` — the security boundary itself — and it recognizes kernel sandbox dialects from argv shapes measured against specific upstream releases. So `peerDependencies` names only the releases that have actually been through the full verification, and startup checks again: if the host's release is not on the list, or several `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages disagree about which release they are, the fs / sandbox / registry / instructions / lsp / workspace-files rows **do not start**, the composition degrades to "this plugin is not installed", and one explanatory line is logged. To diagnose, see [troubleshooting: unsupported DSH release](./docs/troubleshooting/unsupported-dsh-release.md); for the reasoning, [ADR-0009](./docs/decisions/ADR-0009-dsh-compat-contract.md).

## Installation

`dsh plugin` supports four install sources. All commands below use the web profile as the example; for the Electron desktop swap `--profile web` for `--profile desktop` — the install method is the same.

| Source | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| npm registry (upstream package) | `dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` | Upstream's pre-built artifacts, ready to use; **this fork is not published** under its new name, so this command installs the upstream release |
| tarball | `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace-<version>.tgz` | Pre-built offline package, handy for air-gapped or offline delivery — with the same one-time `allowBuilds` answer |
| local path (how this fork is used) | `dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` | pnpm `link:` to a local checkout (its dependencies are already installed in this repository) — best for development and local customization |
| GitHub / git (upstream source) | `dsh plugin --profile web add github:cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace` | Pulls upstream source and builds it on the spot through `prepare` (its package name still carries the scope); needs **two** `allowBuilds` answers (this package plus `koffi`); pin a tag |

**Every install source needs one `allowBuilds` answer the first time.** The plugin carries a native dependency that must be built, `koffi` (the FFI wrapper behind Registry Authority on Windows; installed but unused elsewhere), and pnpm ≥10 runs no dependency lifecycle script by default. So the first `dsh plugin add` fails with `[ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS]` and leaves the pending decision in that profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  koffi: true          # the placeholder dsh leaves is "set this to true or false"
```

Set it to `true` and run `add` again. Read that line as **letting the dependency's install script run on your machine** (outside any sandbox the agent runs in) — `koffi`'s script only precompiles locally. Diagnosis steps: [Troubleshooting: the install stops at build approval](./docs/troubleshooting/install-stops-at-build-approval.md).

### Install from the npm registry (upstream package)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @dsh-electron/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
```

This installs **upstream's** pre-built artifacts (the plugin itself is never compiled), and the first install still needs the `allowBuilds` answer above. This fork renamed the package and is not published to npm; to run this fork's code, use the local-path install below.

### Install from a tarball

```sh
pnpm pack dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
# or download the tgz from the upstream GitHub Release assets (upstream asset names still carry the scope), e.g.:
# https://github.com/cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace/releases/download/v0.1.5/dsh-electron-dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace-0.1.5.tgz
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace-0.1.5.tgz
```

Also pre-built (the plugin itself is never compiled here), handy for air-gapped or offline delivery — and the first `add` needs the same `allowBuilds` answer.

### Install from GitHub

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
```

With pnpm ≥10 the first `add` fails: a git install pulls **source code rather than build artifacts**, so the package's self-contained `prepare` script must build it on the spot (a direct transpile of `src/`, no type-checking). Follow `dsh`'s guidance and copy the exact package keys pnpm prints into the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — this source has **two** pending decisions:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  'dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace': true
  koffi: true
```

Then run `add` again. Pinning a tag (e.g. `#v0.1.5`) is recommended so a later push cannot silently change what actually runs:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace#v0.1.5
```

### Install from a local clone (development & debugging)

This fork is vendored inside dotfiles (`dsh/plugins/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace`) and the profile points at that directory with a pnpm `link:` — once `lib/` is built, `dsh plugin --profile web add <that directory>` is all it takes. The generic source path (including cloning upstream):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cherrchen/dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace.git
cd dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace
export CI=true    # without a TTY, pnpm's dependency self-check aborts; see the development workflow §8
pnpm install
pnpm build        # produces lib/ (not tracked by Git); the artifact test and installation both need it
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"
```

> **Tip**: if your DSH comes from a source checkout (rather than `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`), the `dsh` binary is not on the global PATH — replace `dsh` with `pnpm dsh` in the commands above, e.g. `pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add ...` and `pnpm dsh --profile web`.

## Running

Development gates, with the result each step should produce:

```sh
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck   # expect: 0 warnings, 0 errors; both tsconfigs pass
pnpm test                     # expect: all pass; dialect cases without a local kernel runner skip explicitly, with a reason
pnpm kernel:probe             # expect: reports the kernel runners this host has (seatbelt / bwrap / landlock)
pnpm smoke                    # expect: compose 40/40, behavior 99/99, journey 55/55
pnpm docs:check               # expect: 0 errors, 0 warnings
```

Install into a DSH runtime and verify the composition:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Expected: **only** the `fs-sandbox` and `sandbox` rows are replaced by the plugin's `multi-root-fs` / `multi-root-sandbox`, with ten rows inserted (`multi-root-compat` / `fs` / `sandbox` / `scope` / `registry` / `instructions` / `lsp` / `workspace-files` / `command`, plus the client carrier row `multi-root-client`); `bash-sandbox` stays upstream (bash and the PTY backend take their roots from `ctx.sandbox`). After starting `dsh --profile web`, the Folders action appears at the sidebar foot.

## Usage

**The command** (the text entry point; also available headless):

```text
/workspace-folders                       # list the primary root and the additional roots
/workspace-folders add <absolute path>   # with no path, opens the OS directory chooser
/workspace-folders alias 1 payments      # name the first additional root
/workspace-folders remove 1              # by ordinal or by path
/workspace-folders reveal 1              # show it in the file manager
```

After an `add`, `list` prints:

```text
Workspace root (primary; access follows the current sandbox mode): /home/me/monorepo
  1 /home/me/payments-service [payments]
  2 /home/me/website
Writable additional roots: 2 of 2.
```

**The panel** (Web GUI): the **Folders** dialog at the sidebar foot lists the primary root and the additional roots, and offers add (through the composed directory picker or a typed path), remove, alias, copy path, reveal in the file manager, and move up/down. Its copy is bilingual and follows the interface language. A root's state is shown honestly: `missing` (absent right now) and `redirected` (replaced by a symlink pointing elsewhere) keep their registration but are **not granted**; once the directory is back, a `list` or a panel refresh grants it again — no restart.

**The model side**: the additional-root topology reaches the model through a `systemPrompt.context` snapshot attached to every request (same workspace, cwd unchanged) — no introspection tool needed. The full authorization semantics (canonicalization, `recordedPath` against symlink transplants, conflict rejection) live in the [architecture document](./docs/architecture/multi-root-workspace.md).

## Project Structure

  registry-lease.ts / registry-lease-win32.ts
                  cross-process Registry Authority: POSIX flock and a Windows named semaphore (the kernel releases it on process death)

  fs.ts           the multi-root filesystem provider (in-process fence, extends the upstream LocalFileSystem)
  sandbox.ts      the multi-root kernel-sandbox provider (extends the upstream LocalSandboxProvider)
  dialects.ts     Seatbelt / bwrap / Landlock profile recognition and additional-grant assembly (unrecognized shapes fail loudly)
  containment.ts  path containment (lexical fast path plus a dev/ino alias fallback)
  instructions.ts discovery, incremental delivery, budget and revocation for an additional root's AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md (top level plus the subdirectories this session touched, injected from agent/pre-step)
  compat.ts       the multi-root-compat startup gate (version allowlist and mixed-install detection)
  compat/         the version-difference adapters: dsh-version / sandbox-confine / agent-instructions / llm-message (optional peers loaded on demand)
  command.ts      the /workspace-folders command and the host half of the panel RPC
  contract.ts     the panel wire protocol (zod-validated on both ends, inlinable into the browser bundle)
  client/         the browser half: sidebar action, dialog, bilingual dictionaries

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome:

1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) (repository-wide rules) and the [development workflow](./docs/development/plugin-development-workflow.md) (environment, commands, the runtime support matrix, the upgrade procedure) first.
2. Branch from `main`; follow conventional commits (`feat` / `fix` / `perf` / `refactor` + scope) — see the existing history.
3. All of these must pass locally before a PR: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm docs:check`, `pnpm smoke` (CI runs the same order, build before test).
4. Behavior changes update the matching document under `docs/` in the same change; keep the README bilingual pair in sync; record engineering decisions that involve trade-offs as ADRs.
5. Hard constraint: **never modify any package of the upstream repository (deepseek-harness)**; the plugin stays an out-of-tree extension.

## Known Limitations

- An additional root's instruction files arrive as they become relevant: the one at the root's top level is injected before the session's first step, and a subdirectory's is injected once the session has **successfully** worked in that directory. A nested file is re-examined only when its directory is examined (the root's own every step; a subdirectory's because it was delivered from, or because of a fresh touch), delivery state is in-process (so a resumed session may be told again), and only the `read` / `write` / `edit` tool names count. The primary root's chain and the user-global file remain upstream's job, and this plugin does not inject them a second time ([ADR-0010](./docs/decisions/ADR-0010-additional-root-instruction-scope.md)).
- Single writer per store: only one DSH process at a time may hold the root registry for a given `$DSH_HOME`; another process reports the registry as unavailable (`registry-contended`) and takes over on refresh once the holder exits or crashes. That is deliberate fail-closed behavior, not a race waiting to be fixed ([ADR-0007](./docs/decisions/ADR-0007-registry-authority-lease.md)).
- The supported matrix is an exact-version allowlist: on a host whose release is not on the list, or whose core packages disagree about the release, the `fs` / `sandbox` / `registry` / `instructions` / `lsp` / `workspace-files` rows **do not start** and the composition degrades to "the plugin is not installed" ([ADR-0009](./docs/decisions/ADR-0009-dsh-compat-contract.md)).
- The Windows multi-root runner inherits upstream partial enforcement, caller-owned directory requirements, and private-temp isolation. Running processes retain their initial roots; later processes use the updated set ([ADR-0011](./docs/decisions/ADR-0011-multi-root-workspace-consumers.md)).
- An additional root has the same rights as the primary root (no per-root read-only), and cannot become the default working directory of bash/PTY (session cwd semantics are unchanged).
- Browse additional roots in the Workspace Folders dialog with manual refresh, expandable directories, and previews of up to 200 text lines. The native primary-root Files tab remains and offers a dialog action where supported. LSP uses the containing additional root as its own workspace; the host must configure the relevant language server ([ADR-0011](./docs/decisions/ADR-0011-multi-root-workspace-consumers.md)).
- The command's own output text is English (a host-side handler has no active locale to consult); the panel is bilingual.
- The Workspace Folders panel is a sidebar footer action plus a dialog rather than a full panel: `sidebar.footer.action` is offered by every supported release, whereas `sidebar.panellist` / `main` are not.
