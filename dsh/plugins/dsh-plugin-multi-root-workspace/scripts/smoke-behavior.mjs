/**
 * smoke:behavior — the empty-root pass-through acceptance test plus the
 * additional-root behavior matrix.
 *
 * It boots a real composed profile in-process (no model call, no credentials),
 * runs one battery of filesystem and bash operations against the mounted
 * services, and does so twice: once with `mr-plugin` (this bundle installed) and
 * once with `mr-baseline` (the same composition without it). Every recorded
 * outcome must be identical — that is what "installed plugin behaves exactly
 * like no plugin" means for the empty-root case — while the provider IDENTITY
 * must differ.
 *
 * It then repeats both batteries under `read-only`, which is the other half of
 * the requirement: the mode must keep denying writes through `ctx.fs` and
 * through `ctx.shell`, with the upstream denial facts intact.
 *
 * Finally it registers an additional root on the plugin's scope service and
 * asserts the multi-root behavior end to end: the fence grants that root, the
 * HOST dialect's own profile gains it (read straight out of `ctx.sandbox.confine`,
 * so the assertion holds even where a confined process cannot be spawned), the
 * denial names every allowed root, and — when this process can actually run a
 * confined command — bash writes the additional root while the outside tree
 * stays denied. `read-only` must leave the additional root ungranted.
 *
 * The run is isolated: a scratch `$DSH_HOME` and a fixture tree under the
 * repository's ignored `.dsh-smoke/` directory (outside `/tmp`, so containment
 * denials are meaningful rather than satisfied by a temporary grant).
 *
 * @module scripts/smoke-behavior
