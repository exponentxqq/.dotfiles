/**
 * upgrade-dsh — repoint this repository's DSH pin at one upstream release.
 *
 * The upgrade lane's job is to answer a single question: would this plugin
 * still be correct if the harness were release X? Answering it requires the
 * whole repository to be pinned at X — `devDependencies`, the release-age
 * allowances, and the lockfile — because the fence and the kernel-sandbox
 * dialects are verified against the copy that is actually installed, not
 * against a range.
 *
 * This script performs exactly that repointing and nothing else. It does NOT
 * touch `SUPPORTED_DSH_RELEASES` or `peerDependencies`: a green upgrade lane is
 * evidence that a release COULD be supported, and promoting it is a human act
 * performed afterwards (ADR-0009). That separation is the whole point — a
 * scheduled job that widened the support matrix on its own would reintroduce the
 * over-promise this contract was written to remove.
 *
 * ```bash
 * node scripts/upgrade-dsh.mjs 0.1.6-alpha.1   # pin an exact release
 * node scripts/upgrade-dsh.mjs --latest-prerelease   # pin the newest published
 * node scripts/upgrade-dsh.mjs --print-latest-prerelease   # just report it
 * node scripts/upgrade-dsh.mjs --print-installed   # report the resolved tree
 *
 * pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile --config.minimumReleaseAge=0
 * DSH_MULTI_ROOT_COMPAT=warn pnpm verify:all
 * ```
 *
 * Reverting is `git checkout -- package.json pnpm-workspace.yaml pnpm-lock.yaml`.
 * That is safe in CI, which always runs on a clean checkout, and it is the ONLY
 * way back this script offers on purpose — a backup file would be a second
 * source of truth for "what the pin was".
 *
 * Locally it is a loaded gun: it reverts those three files to HEAD *entirely*,
 * so any UNCOMMITTED edit to them — a new script, a widened peer range — is
 * destroyed along with the pin. Commit or stash before running an upgrade probe
 * over dirty manifests.
 *
 * @module scripts/upgrade-dsh
