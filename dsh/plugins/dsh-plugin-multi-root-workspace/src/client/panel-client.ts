/**
 * The panel's own client for the Connection RPC channel.
 *
 * The browser half cannot use a Typert Remote namespace: contract generation
 * is workspace-shaped and the client assembly's contribution list belongs to
 * the shipped composition, so an out-of-tree plugin has no supported way to
 * mount one (see docs/decisions/ADR-0005 and the M3 plan). What IS public and
 * present in both supported runtimes is the generic Connection channel the
 * shipped sibling plugin already uses: the host registers
 * `connection.rpc.handle(PANEL_CHANNEL, …)` and this module calls it.
 *
 * The call is typed by {@link PanelResponseMap}: the endpoint decides the
 * request shape AND the response type, so a caller cannot decode one endpoint's
 * answer as another's. The response is additionally parsed at the boundary,
 * because the type is a promise about the host while the value on the wire is
 * whatever the host actually sent.
