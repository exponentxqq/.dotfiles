/**
 * `MultiRootSandboxProvider`: the kernel-sandbox dialect provider mounted as
 * `ctx.sandbox`.
 *
 * Every confined execution in this composition funnels through `confine()` —
 * the bash executor wraps `['bash','-c',command]`, and the terminal backend
 * wraps its PTY spawn argv — so widening the grant here is what gives bash, PTY,
 * and the fs fence one and the same root set (requirement §13). The bash
 * executor itself is therefore left upstream: it never computes roots.
 *
 * POSIX widening lives in `./dialects.ts`, Windows capabilities in
 * `./windows-profile.ts` and `./windows-runner.ts`: the upstream profile builders
 * are unreachable in the published package, so the additional roots are grafted
 * onto the profile `super.confine` actually produced (recognize the dialect
 * structurally, clone its grant spelling, fail loudly when the shape is not
 * known). This class owns only the policy that decides WHEN to graft:
 *
 * 1. with no additional roots, or under any mode other than `workspace-write`,
 *    the upstream result is returned ELEMENT FOR ELEMENT — same argv, same
 *    `enforcement`, same `denialSignatures`, same `runnerFailureRules`;
 * 2. `enforcement`, `denialSignatures`, and `runnerFailureRules` are NEVER
 *    recomputed here, even when the argv is widened — the bash executor derives
 *    its denial and enforcement reporting from them;
 * 3. only `argv` may differ, and a dialect whose shape cannot be extended fails
 *    loudly (`SandboxUnavailableError`) instead of silently confining to the
 *    primary root alone.
