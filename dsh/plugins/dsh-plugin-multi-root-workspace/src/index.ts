/**
 * Barrel for the multi-root workspace bundle's host half.
 *
 * The loader mounts the plugin's responsibilities through the subpath entries
 * declared in `package.json` and `cordis.patch.yml` (`./fs`, `./sandbox`,
 * `./scope`, `./registry`, `./command`); this entry carries only the no-op
 * `apply` below. The patch still inserts a row with THIS specifier (the bare
 * package name) because the web client-module scan reads a package's
 * `dsh.client` declaration solely from a loader row mounted at its package
 * root — subpath rows are never client rows — so without that row the browser
 * is never served `lib/client.js` and the sidebar footer action never
 * registers. The barrel itself stays side-effect free so tests can import the
 * whole public surface from a single specifier.
 *
 * The two facts worth remembering about this surface: a registration carries the
 * canonical directory it was GRANTED for (`recordedPath`), the panel channel
 * has one declared response shape per endpoint (`PanelResponseMap`), and the
 * panel primary root is derived from a live host session — never named by the
 * browser.
