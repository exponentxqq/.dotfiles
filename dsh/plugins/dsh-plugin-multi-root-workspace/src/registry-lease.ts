/**
 * Store-wide kernel lease for the multi-root registry.
 *
 * The JSON storage backend is memory-authoritative after `open`: it reads the
 * domain document once, then every write is an atomic rewrite of that in-memory
 * snapshot. Two DSH processes sharing one storage root can therefore each grant
 * a stale set, and a later rewrite silently drops the other process's mutation.
 * The in-process `chains` queue in `registry.ts` cannot see that race.
 *
 * This lease makes one process the Registry Authority for the whole
 * `multi_root_workspace` medium. The arbiter is the kernel, matching upstream
 * session JSONL persistence: POSIX non-blocking `flock(2)` via
 * `@deepseek-ai/node-addon-system/flock`, Windows a named kernel semaphore.
 * There is no TTL and no stale-PID algorithm — the kernel releases the lock
 * when the holder's descriptor (or last object handle) closes, including on
 * crash. See ADR-0007.
