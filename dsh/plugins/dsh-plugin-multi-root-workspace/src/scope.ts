/**
 * The multi-root workspace scope: the plugin's single home for the question
 * "which directories belong to this workspace".
 *
 * The primary root is never stored here — it is the session's immutable cwd as
 * resolved by the upstream `ctx.sandboxPolicy` service. This service owns the
 * additional roots, the canonical key that indexes them, and the one model-facing
 * statement of that topology, so every enforcing provider (fs fence,
 * kernel-sandbox dialects) and the prompt snapshot all resolve the same scope.
 *
 * The root table is still filled by the registry's own API (tests and smoke
 * scripts today; plugin storage in M3). Keeping the empty case on the same code
 * path as the populated one is deliberate — the pass-through safety net must
 * exercise the real provider wiring, not a stub that later gets replaced.
