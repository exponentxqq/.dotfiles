/**
 * Compatibility adapter for upstream's instruction discovery and rendering.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-instructions` renamed its renderer between two
 * releases this plugin supports, without changing its signature:
 *
 * ```text
 * 0.1.5-rc.2     renderWorkspaceContext(files, options)   RenderedWorkspaceContext
 * 0.1.6-alpha.1  renderAgentInstructions(files, options)  RenderedAgentInstructions
 * ```
 *
 * `discoverBaselineInstructionFiles` kept both its name and its signature.
 *
 * All coupling to that package is concentrated here so the business layer
 * (`src/instructions.ts`) only ever calls {@link renderInstructions} and
 * {@link InstructionsApi.discover}. A future rename is one edit in this file,
 * not a version check sprinkled through the provider.
 *
 * The export is picked by NAME rather than by comparing the release string:
 * a structural probe also copes with upstream keeping both names for a release,
 * or reshaping within one, which a version comparison does not.
 *
 * The package is loaded LAZILY, and its genuine ABSENCE is reported as absence
 * rather than thrown. It is an optional peer: the default DSH bundle mounts it,
 * but a minimal composition legitimately has neither it nor an agent, and in
 * that case this plugin's instruction row must simply contribute nothing. A
 * package that is present but cannot be evaluated is a different answer, and
 * one this adapter reports instead of caching as absence.
 *
