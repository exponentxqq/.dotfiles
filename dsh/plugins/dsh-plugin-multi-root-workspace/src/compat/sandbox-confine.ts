/**
 * Compatibility adapter for the one upstream signature that changed shape
 * between two releases this plugin supports.
 *
 * ```text
 * 0.1.5-rc.2     confine(argv, policy): ConfinedArgv
 * 0.1.6-alpha.1  confine(argv, policy, signal?): Promise<ConfinedArgv>
 * ```
 *
 * The widening itself (`src/dialects.ts`) is pure string work on the argv the
 * upstream provider produced, so nothing about it needs to be async. The only
 * problem is the SHAPE of the call: an override must accept what the installed
 * base class declares and return what its caller expects. This module is where
 * that is solved, once:
 *
 * - the return type is expressed as {@link UpstreamConfined}, derived from the
 *   installed base class, so it resolves to `ConfinedArgv` on one release and
 *   `Promise<ConfinedArgv>` on the other without two hand-written signatures;
 * - {@link widenConfined} preserves the shape it was handed — a synchronous
 *   base result stays synchronous, a promise stays a promise. It never wraps a
 *   sync result in a promise, because on `0.1.5-rc.2` that would change
 *   `ctx.sandbox.confine()` from a value into a thenable for every caller in
 *   the composition, including the bash executor and the PTY backend.
 *
 * The single unavoidable cast lives here too, and nowhere else: `super.confine`
 * has a different arity per release, so calling it uniformly needs one
 * assertion to {@link ConfineCall}.
