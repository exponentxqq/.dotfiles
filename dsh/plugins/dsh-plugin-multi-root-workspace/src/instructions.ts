/**
 * `multi-root-instructions`: the additional roots' own instruction files, made
 * visible to the model.
 *
 * Upstream `agent-instructions` discovers instruction files by walking UP from
 * the session cwd (plus the one user-global file). In a multi-root workspace
 * that walk never reaches an additional root, so `repo-b/AGENTS.md` is
 * invisible to a model that is nevertheless allowed to write `repo-b`. This row
 * closes exactly that gap, and nothing else: the primary root's chain — nested
 * files included — and the user-global file stay upstream's business.
 *
 * Four deliberate choices:
 *
 * 1. **Not a system-prompt contribution.** Instruction text is
 *    producer-supplied context, not system authority, so it enters as a
 *    user-role message tagged `form: 'instructions'`. Through session format 3
 *    the source kind is `plugin`; format 4 retired that shared kind, so the
 *    adapter persists this plugin's own (`multi-root-workspace`). It is also
 *    the only channel that is logged, and model-visible content must be logged.
 * 2. **Injected from `agent/pre-step`, not a session lifecycle event.**
 *    `pre-step` is an awaited waterfall, so discovery, reading and rendering all
 *    complete BEFORE the step it feeds — deterministically, on the first step.
 *    A synchronous prompt callback could not await them, and an emit-mode
 *    lifecycle listener would race the first step. It is also the one hook whose
 *    shape is identical across every supported release, which keeps the
 *    instruction feature out of the compatibility matrix (ADR-0009).
 * 3. **Discovery is pinned to the root.** `projectRoot` is the additional root,
 *    so the walk can never leave it, and every candidate is then required to be
 *    canonically INSIDE that root. That is what keeps `$DSH_HOME/AGENTS.md`, the
 *    primary root's `AGENTS.md`, and any ancestor's file from being injected a
 *    second time by this plugin.
 * 4. **Nested files are driven by the session's own tool activity.** A
 *    subdirectory's `AGENTS.md` only matters once the session has worked in that
 *    subdirectory, so the directories worth examining are derived from the
 *    session's persisted events: `tool/call` and `tool/result` are paired, and a
 *    successful `read`/`write`/`edit` makes the path from the root down to the
 *    touched file's directory relevant (ADR-0010). A file that disappears is
 *    retracted explicitly, because the text it contributed earlier is still in
 *    the conversation and silence does not withdraw it.
 *
 * The byte budget is shared: `maxBytes` bounds the WHOLE additional-root
 * snapshot, not each root, because ten roots must not quietly cost ten budgets
 * of context. Roots consume it in scope order. Retractions are exempt, because a
 * truncated withdrawal is worse than a slightly over-budget message.
