/**
 * `multi-root-compat`: the startup gate that turns the DSH compatibility
 * contract from documentation into a precondition.
 *
 * The four security-relevant rows of this bundle — `multi-root-fs`,
 * `multi-root-sandbox`, `multi-root-registry`, `multi-root-instructions` —
 * inject `multiRootCompat`. Cordis will not start a plugin whose injected
 * service is absent, so this row is what decides whether they run at all:
 *
 * ```text
 * compat check passes  →  ctx.multiRootCompat exists  →  the providers start
 * compat check fails   →  the row throws             →  they never start
 * ```
 *
 * That is why the gate is a plain `apply` and not a `Service` subclass mounted
 * directly: the check has to be able to fail BEFORE the service exists. A
 * `Service` constructor has already run `super(ctx, name)` — and therefore
 * already claimed the service key — by the time it could inspect anything.
 *
 * The verdict itself, and the allowlist it is judged against, live in
 * `./compat/dsh-version.ts`. This module owns only the reaction to it.
 *
 * @module dsh-plugin-multi-root-workspace/compat
