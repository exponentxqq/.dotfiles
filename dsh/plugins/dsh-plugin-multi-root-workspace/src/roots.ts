/**
 * The root vocabulary: identities, the durable record shape, the status a
 * stored record is reported with, and the validation rules every write and
 * every startup re-read passes through.
 *
 * This module is the single home of "what makes a directory a legal additional
 * root" (requirement §15). Both the registry (which persists) and the command
 * and panel surfaces (which report) speak these types, so a rule can never be
 * enforced on one path and forgotten on another.
 *
 * Rules, applied in this order — the first failure names the reason:
 *
 * 1. `not-absolute` — a relative input (after `~` expansion) is a
 *    misconfiguration, not a path to guess at.
 * 2. `missing` — the directory does not exist.
 * 3. `not-a-directory` — it exists but is not a directory.
 * 4. `equals-primary` — the canonical candidate IS the session's workspace
 *    root, which is already granted by the upstream policy.
 * 5. `primary-overlap` — the candidate lies under the workspace root, or
 *    contains it. The union grants nothing new, and the displayed list would
 *    stop matching the enforced root set.
 * 6. `duplicate` — another registered root canonicalizes to the same path.
 * 7. `nested` — the candidate lies under a registered root, or contains one.
 *    Same reasoning as rule 5, applied to the additional roots.
 *
 * The stored side of the same rules lives in {@link classifyStoredRoots}, which
 * must never throw: a registration that stopped being usable is REPORTED, not
 * deleted, so the operator can see it and remove it deliberately.
 *
