/**
 * The M2 core asset: the cross-provider allow matrix.
 *
 * Requirement §4 / acceptance 4 say there must be no combination in which one
 * tool can write an additional root while another cannot. Upstream guarantees
 * that with a shared `writableRoots()` derivation plus its own parity test; after
 * this plugin replaces both providers, the guarantee is ours to maintain. So for
 * one scope — primary root, one additional root, a third tree outside every root,
 * and a sibling that shares the primary root's lexical prefix — this suite
 * compares, path class by path class and mode by mode:
 *
 * - what the in-process filesystem fence ACTUALLY does (a real write attempt), and
 * - what the kernel dialect profile ACTUALLY grants (parsed out of the wrapped
 *   argv by `tests/support/dialect-grants.ts`, an implementation independent of
 *   the production widening code).
 *
 * Every dialect is exercised from any host by forcing the runner chain through
 * the provider's public `internals` hook, so the matrix is complete even where a
 * backend cannot execute (macOS has no bwrap, a confined process cannot nest
 * `sandbox-exec`). The real-execution cases at the bottom then spawn the wrapped
 * argv itself wherever the host CAN run it — Linux CI for bwrap/Landlock, macOS
 * for Seatbelt — and skip explicitly, with the reason, where it cannot. A dialect
 * the PLATFORM provides is required, so its skip becomes a failure: macOS must run
 * the Seatbelt case, Linux must run bwrap or Landlock, and neither is asked for
 * the runner it does not have (see `tests/support/kernel-runner.ts`). Windows has
 * no kernel rung here at all, so the suite skips there with that reason.
